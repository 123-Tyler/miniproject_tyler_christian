"Units, notes and date ranges"
"Data are presented as an index; the first year of the available time series for each specific index is set to 100.

Some cells in the tables refer to notes which can be found in the notes worksheet. Note markers are presented in square brackets, for example: [note 1].

Some column headings give date ranges, when this is the case the data ranges are presented in round brackets to differentiate them from note markers.  "
